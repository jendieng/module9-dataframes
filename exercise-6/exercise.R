# Exercise 6: Husky Football 2015 Season
# Read in the Husky Football 2015 game data into a variable called `husky.games.2015`



# Create a vector of the teams that the Huskies played against during that season

teams.played <- c("Boise State", "Sacremento State", "Utah State", "California", "Southern California", "Oregon", "Stanford", "Arizona", "Utah", "Arizona State", "Oregona State", "Washington", "Southern Mississippi")


# Create a vector of the their final scores for the games
# Call this variable `husky.scores`

husky.scores <- c("13", "49", "31", "24", "17", "20", "14", "49", "23", "23", "52", "45", "44")

# Create 2 variables called `rushing.yards` and `passing.yards` to represent the yards the Huskies rushed and passed

passing.yard <- "150, 326, 368, 152, 164, 205, 118, 267, 257, 405, 211, 203, 284"
rushing.yard <- "29, 218, 74, 107, 135, 180, 113, 201, 124, 142, 271, 240, 296"

# Create a variable called `combined.yards` that is the total yardage of the Huskies for each game

combined.yard <- 

# Add the `combined.yards` vector to the dataframe with the column name being `combined`



# Write the dataframe to a new `.csv` file called `huskies_2015_improved.csv` into the `data directory`



# What is the score of the game where the Huskies had the most combined yards?



# Define a function `MostYardsScore` that takes in an argument `games` (a data frame) and
# returns a descriptive sentence about the game that was played that had the most yards scored in it.



# Challenge!
# What was the highest yardage game so far this season?
# Hint: Read in the dataset titled `huskies_2016.csv` and save it as a variable
